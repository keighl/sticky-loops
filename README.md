# Sticky Loops

> What does a brainstorm sound like?

Good question! The tech industry has grappled with this quandry since before the dot-com bust. But grapple no longer, my friend. Sticky Loops takes any sticky notes in a Figjam document and tranforms them into an awesome drum machine.

Useful for...

* Priotizing ideas by downbeat
* Setting the tempo of your meeting
* Daily scrum concerts
* Metronome-based design and ideation
* Effective 1:1s

Instructions

1. Open a Figjam document
2. Select some sticky notes
3. Run the `Sticky Loops` plugin
4. Listen to your work
